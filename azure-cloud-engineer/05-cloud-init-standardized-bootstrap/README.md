# Standardized Linux Bootstrap in Azure with cloud-init

## What I built

A VM that bootstraps itself automatically:

- install nginx
- create a user
- write an HTML page
- enable and start nginx

## Success criteria

- nginx installed automatically at boot
- page reachable over HTTP
- cloud-init logs show successful run
